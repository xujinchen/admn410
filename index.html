            <h3>History</h3> -            
            Our company was founded on May 5th,2007 by William Bruce. We only sold pet food at first. After several years development and market research, we found that pet toy also has a large market potential so we started it. So far we own 4 chain of stores and we intend to provide best pet products to our customers.
